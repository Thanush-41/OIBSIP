                Shreyas Santosh Iyer (born 6 December 1994) is an Indian international cricketer who plays for the Indian cricket team as a right-handed batter. He has played in all formats for the Indian team. Iyer scored a century in his debut test match and a half-century in the second innings against New Zealand in November 2021 and became the first Indian player to do so.[1][2] Iyer plays for Mumbai in domestic cricket and captains Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League. He played for the India Under-19 cricket team at the 2014 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup.[3] He was named in the India Squad for 2023 Cricket World Cup.

                He made headlines when Delhi Daredevils bought him at the 2015 IPL auction for Rs 2.6 crore (about US$416,000). It was faith he repaid with interest: he made 439 runs that season, and won the IPL Emerging Player of the Year award. Over the next six seasons, he became a mainstay of the side and its captain, making over 400 runs a season for them four times.[4]
